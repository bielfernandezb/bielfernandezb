# üëã Hi there, my name is Biel Fern√°ndez.

### I'm an Android Develover ‚ù§Ô∏è who builds robust, performant, and elegant Apps. I'm also fascinated by low-level software and because of that I've done my fair share of projects in a variety of languages in the past. Nowadays, and because of my job role as an Android developer, I pretty much only use Kotlin. I'm currently based in Barcelona, Spain, where I'm a member of the Android Team at O2O - MO2O /Digital Business & Transformation. When I'm not working / slacking / hanging out with friends, I try to find time to work on open source and side-projects.
